\title{Quasi Expected Hypervolume Improvement (constraint-aware)}
\usage{
acq_qehvi(unit_x, surrogates, constraint_tbl, objective, best_feasible)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit_x}{list of candidate points on the unit hypercube.}

\item{surrogates}{named list of fitted surrogate models (as returned by [fit_surrogates()]).}

\item{constraint_tbl}{tibble from [parse_constraints()].}

\item{objective}{name of the objective metric (character scalar).}

\item{best_feasible}{best observed value of the objective among feasible points
(numeric scalar or `Inf` if none observed).}
}
\value{
numeric vector of acquisition scores.
}
\description{
\strong{Note:} This function is currently a placeholder that calls
[acq_eci()]. A full qEHVI implementation with proper hypervolume computation
is planned for a future release.

For batch size greater than one, the function uses a sequential (Kriging
believer) approximation via constrained expected improvement.
