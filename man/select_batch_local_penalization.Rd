\title{Select diverse batch using local penalization}
\usage{
select_batch_local_penalization(candidates, acq_scores, q, lipschitz = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidates}{list of candidate points (unit scale)}

\item{acq_scores}{numeric vector of acquisition values for each candidate}

\item{q}{batch size (number of points to select)}

\item{lipschitz}{Lipschitz constant for penalization. Higher values enforce
greater diversity. Default estimated from typical BO landscapes.}
}
\value{
integer vector of indices of selected candidates
}
\description{
Implements the local penalization strategy of González et al. (2016).
Iteratively selects points by penalizing acquisition near previously
selected points, ensuring spatial diversity in batch selection.
