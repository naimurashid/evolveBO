\usage{
acq_eci(
  unit_x,
  surrogates,
  constraint_tbl,
  objective,
  best_feasible,
  pred = NULL,
  prob_feas = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit_x}{list of candidate points on the unit hypercube.}

\item{surrogates}{named list of fitted surrogate models (as returned by [fit_surrogates()]).}

\item{constraint_tbl}{tibble from [parse_constraints()].}

\item{objective}{name of the objective metric (character scalar).}

\item{best_feasible}{best observed value of the objective among feasible points
(numeric scalar or `Inf` if none observed).}

\item{pred}{optional list of surrogate predictions (as from [predict_surrogates()]).
When supplied, avoids recomputing GP predictions for acquisition scoring.}

\item{prob_feas}{optional vector of feasibility probabilities aligned with `unit_x`.
If NULL, computed internally from `pred` and `constraint_tbl`.}
}
\value{
numeric vector of acquisition scores for each candidate.
}
