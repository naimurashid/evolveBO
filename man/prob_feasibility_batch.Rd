\title{Batch probability of feasibility (vectorized across candidates)}
\usage{
prob_feasibility_batch(pred, constraint_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{list of predictions from predict_surrogates (contains mean and sd for each metric)}

\item{constraint_tbl}{tibble from parse_constraints}
}
\value{
numeric vector of feasibility probabilities for each candidate
}
\description{
PERFORMANCE: Computes P(feasible) for all candidates at once instead of
calling prob_feasibility in a loop. This reduces purrr::map overhead from
O(n_candidates × n_constraints) to O(n_constraints).
