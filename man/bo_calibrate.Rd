\arguments{
\item{sim_fun}{callback with signature
`function(theta, fidelity = c("low","med","high"), ...)` returning a named
numeric vector of operating characteristics (e.g., `power`, `type1`, `EN`,
`ET`). The function should attach attributes `variance` (named numeric
vector of Monte Carlo variances) and `n_rep` (number of simulator
replications) for best results. If `variance` is not provided, a binomial
approximation is used for metrics in [0,1], and a small nugget is used for
other metrics.}

\item{bounds}{named list of length-two numeric vectors specifying lower and
upper limits for each design parameter.}

\item{objective}{name of the operating characteristic to minimise (character).}

\item{constraints}{named list mapping metric -> `c(direction, threshold)` with
`direction` in `{"ge","le"}`.}

\item{n_init}{number of initial design evaluations generated via Latin
hypercube sampling.}

\item{q}{batch size for each BO iteration (number of new evaluations per
acquisition round).}

\item{budget}{total number of simulator evaluations (initial + BO iterations).}

\item{seed}{base RNG seed for reproducibility.}

\item{fidelity_levels}{named numeric vector giving the number of simulator
replications associated with each fidelity level (defaults to low/med/high).}

\item{acquisition}{acquisition rule to use (currently only `"eci"` is
implemented).}

\item{candidate_pool}{number of random candidate points assessed per
acquisition step.}

\item{covtype}{covariance kernel passed to [fit_surrogates()].}

\item{integer_params}{optional character vector of parameters that should be
rounded to the nearest integer prior to simulation.}

\item{progress}{logical; if `TRUE` (default) messages are emitted at key
milestones.}

\item{...}{additional arguments forwarded to `sim_fun`.}
}
\value{
An object of class `evolveBO_fit` containing the optimisation history,
  best design, fitted surrogates, policy configuration, and posterior draws
  supporting sensitivity diagnostics.
}
\description{
Implements the methodology described in Section 2 of the manuscript:
heteroskedastic Gaussian process emulation, expected constrained improvement,
and multi-fidelity simulation budgeting. The function orchestrates initial
design selection, surrogate fitting, sequential acquisition, and diagnostic
bookkeeping required for downstream benchmarking and reporting.
