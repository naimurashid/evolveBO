\title{Select fidelity using staged multi-fidelity strategy}
\usage{
select_fidelity_staged(
  prob_feasible,
  cv_estimate,
  iter,
  fidelity_levels,
  cv_threshold = 0.05,
  prob_range = c(0.2, 0.8),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob_feasible}{probability of constraint satisfaction}

\item{cv_estimate}{coefficient of variation from surrogate}

\item{iter}{current iteration number}

\item{fidelity_levels}{named vector of fidelity levels}
}
\description{
Implements the staged approach described in manuscript Section 2.4:
- Iterations 1-30: uniform low fidelity for exploration
- Iterations 31-100: adaptive selection based on feasibility and CV
- Iterations 101+: high fidelity near optimum and boundaries
