\arguments{
\item{sim_fun}{callback with signature
`function(theta, fidelity = c("low","med","high"), ...)` returning a named
numeric vector of operating characteristics (e.g., `power`, `type1`, `EN`,
`ET`). The function should attach attributes `variance` (named numeric
vector of Monte Carlo variances) and `n_rep` (number of simulator
replications) for best results. If `variance` is not provided, a binomial
approximation is used for metrics in [0,1], and a small nugget is used for
other metrics.}

\item{bounds}{named list of length-two numeric vectors specifying lower and
upper limits for each design parameter.}

\item{objective}{name of the operating characteristic to minimise (character).}

\item{constraints}{named list mapping metric -> `c(direction, threshold)` with
`direction` in `{"ge","le"}`.}

\item{kernel_options}{character vector of covariance kernels to compare.}

\item{acquisition_options}{character vector of acquisition strategies.}

\item{prior_specs}{optional named list describing alternative priors (stored
for reporting purposes).}

\item{bo_args}{list of arguments forwarded to [bo_calibrate()].}

\item{sobol_samples}{number of Monte Carlo points for Sobol indices.}

\item{gradient_points}{number of gradient evaluation points.}

\item{integer_params}{optional character vector of parameters that should be
rounded to the nearest integer prior to simulation.}

\item{progress}{logical; if `TRUE` (default) messages are emitted at key
milestones.}

\item{...}{additional arguments forwarded to `sim_fun`.}
}
\value{
List containing Sobol indices, gradient draws, kernel comparison
  metrics, and acquisition summaries.
