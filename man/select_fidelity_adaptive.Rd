\description{
Implements cost-aware fidelity selection inspired by MFKG (Wu & Frazier 2016).
Selects fidelity by maximizing expected value per unit cost, with exploration
decay and boundary detection.
}
\details{
The method balances information gain vs cost using:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Value score}: acquisition * uncertainty * boundary_factor
    \itemize{
      \item High near feasibility boundary (prob ~= 0.5)
      \item High when objective uncertain (large CV)
      \item High for promising candidates (large acquisition)
    }
  \item \strong{Cost normalization}: Divide by cost^alpha where alpha decays from 0.5 to 0.8
    \itemize{
      \item Early: less cost-sensitive (exploration)
      \item Late: more cost-sensitive (exploitation)
    }
  \item \strong{Exploration decay}: Randomization probability from 50% to 10%
