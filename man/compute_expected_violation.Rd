\title{Compute expected constraint violation}
\usage{
compute_expected_violation(pred, constraint_tbl, metric_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{list of predictions from predict_surrogates (contains mean and sd for each metric)}

\item{constraint_tbl}{tibble from parse_constraints}

\item{metric_names}{character vector of metric names}
}
\value{
numeric vector of expected violations for each candidate
}
\description{
For each candidate point, computes the expected magnitude of constraint
violations under the GP posterior. Used to guide search toward feasible
region when no feasible solutions have been found yet.
