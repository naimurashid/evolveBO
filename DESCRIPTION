Description: Provides a modular framework for constrained Bayesian optimization of Bayesian adaptive clinical trial designs, particularly those with time-to-event endpoints. Implements heteroskedastic Gaussian process surrogates, constraint-aware acquisition functions, multi-fidelity simulation, and emulator-based sensitivity and covariance analyses to guide efficient design calibration under power and type I error constraints.
