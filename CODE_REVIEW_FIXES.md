# Code Review Fixes Applied

## Summary
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the evolveBO package based on a comprehensive code review. All tests pass after these changes.

## Critical Fixes (Must Fix)

### 1. Fixed parameter mismatch bug in benchmark.R ✅
**Location**: `R/benchmark.R:247`

**Issue**: Grid strategy was passing `constraints = constraints` to `record_evaluation()`, but that function only accepts `constraint_tbl`.

**Fix**: Removed the erroneous `constraints` parameter from the `record_evaluation()` call in the grid strategy.

**Impact**: Grid search strategy now works correctly without runtime errors.

---

### 2. Fixed misleading qEHVI implementation ✅
**Location**: `R/acquisition.R:39-60`, `NAMESPACE:5`

**Issue**: `acq_qehvi()` was exported and documented as "Quasi Expected Hypervolume Improvement" but was just an alias for `acq_eci()`, which could mislead users.

**Fix**:
- Changed to `@keywords internal` to remove from exports
- Added clear warning message when the function is called
- Updated documentation to explicitly state this is a placeholder
- Removed from NAMESPACE exports

**Impact**: Users won't be misled by a non-existent qEHVI implementation. Function remains for internal use with clear warnings.

---

## High Priority Fixes

### 3. Added parameter validation to bo_calibrate ✅
**Location**: `R/bo_calibrate.R:62-78`

**Issue**: Missing validation for critical parameters could lead to cryptic errors.

**Fix**: Added validation checks for:
- `n_init > 0`
- `q > 0` (batch size must be positive)
- `budget > 0`
- `candidate_pool > 0`
- Warning when `budget < n_init`

**Impact**: Users get clear, actionable error messages for invalid inputs instead of cryptic runtime failures.

---

### 4. Added error handling for GP fitting failures ✅
**Location**: `R/surrogates.R:62-85`

**Issue**: `DiceKriging::km()` can fail with ill-conditioned covariance matrices, but failures weren't caught.

**Fix**: Wrapped GP fitting in `tryCatch` with informative error message indicating:
- Which metric failed
- The underlying error
- Helpful guidance about possible causes

**Impact**: Users get clear diagnostic information when GP fitting fails instead of cryptic errors from deep in the DiceKriging package.

---

### 5. Improved default variance estimator with comprehensive documentation ✅
**Location**: `R/bo_calibrate.R:9-16, 308-344`

**Issue**: The default variance estimator only worked for proportion-type metrics (in [0,1]), silently returning NA for continuous metrics like EN and ET. This behavior was undocumented and could be surprising.

**Analysis**: After investigation, the current implementation is actually correct:
- For proportions (power, type1): Uses binomial variance formula `p(1-p)/n`
- For continuous metrics (EN, ET): Returns NA, triggering homoskedastic GP with nugget

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining the behavior
- Updated `bo_calibrate()` parameter docs to recommend providing variance attributes
- Added clear comments in the code explaining the logic
- Documented that NA values trigger nugget-based GP fitting

**Impact**: Users understand the fallback behavior and know when to provide variance estimates. No functional change, just clarity.

---

### 6. Fixed empty history bounds inference ✅
**Location**: `R/case_study.R:132-142`

**Issue**: `infer_bounds_from_history()` would crash with obscure error if history was empty.

**Fix**: Added early validation:
- Check if history is NULL or has 0 rows
- Check if theta_values is empty
- Clear error message: "Cannot infer bounds from empty history."

**Impact**: Clear, actionable error instead of cryptic indexing errors.

---

### 7. Added warning when no feasible points exist ✅
**Location**: `R/bo_calibrate.R:380-389`

**Issue**: When optimization finds no feasible solutions, it silently returns the best infeasible point, which could be confusing.

**Fix**: Added warning message: "No feasible solutions found; returning best infeasible point."

**Impact**: Users are explicitly informed when the returned solution doesn't satisfy constraints.

---

## Additional Robustness Improvements

### 8. Added validation to grid expansion ✅
**Location**: `R/benchmark.R:338-355`

**Fix**: Added checks for:
- Resolution parameter exists
- Each resolution value is positive
- Clear error messages for each failure mode

**Impact**: Grid search fails fast with clear errors instead of producing invalid grids.

---

### 9. Improved Sobol calculation robustness ✅
**Location**: `R/sensitivity.R:35-46`

**Fix**: Added warnings for edge cases:
- When surrogate predictions return NULL/empty
- When surrogate has near-zero variance (< 1e-10)
- Clear messages explaining why Sobol indices may be unreliable

**Impact**: Users are informed when sensitivity analysis results may not be meaningful.

---

## Testing Results

All changes verified with test suite:

```
✔ | F W  S  OK | Context
✔ |          1 | basic
✔ |   1     15 | evolveBO-core [20.6s]

[ FAIL 0 | WARN 3 | SKIP 0 | PASS 16 ]
```

**Warnings are expected and informative:**
1. qEHVI placeholder warning (intentional)
2. Sobol prediction edge case (new robustness check)
3. Acquisition comparison qEHVI call (intentional)

## Recommendation for Next Steps

1. **Implement proper qEHVI** - Currently a placeholder; consider implementing true hypervolume-based acquisition
2. **Expand test coverage** - Add tests for edge cases, error conditions, and numerical accuracy
3. **Extract magic numbers** - Define package-level constants for thresholds (0.75, 0.4, 1e-6, etc.)
4. **Add examples** - Many exported functions lack `@examples` in documentation
5. **Consider hetGP integration** - The package imports hetGP but doesn't use it; consider heteroskedastic GP implementation
